## ðŸ“‚ Projects Included

### `1_Website_Summarizer_using_qwen_by_ollama.ipynb`
Summarizes the content of any website using the **Qwen model** via **Ollama**, providing a compact, AI-generated overview of web pages for quick understanding.

### `2_Personal_Helping_Chatbot.ipynb`
A conversational chatbot that can assist with various tasks, built using a compact LLM. Itâ€™s designed to be personalized and context-aware for enhanced productivity.

### `3_Multi-Ai_Streaming_Chat_Interface.ipynb`
A multi-model streaming chat interface that allows real-time interaction with different LLMs. This demonstrates model switching, prompt handling, and token streaming.

### `4_Meeting_Minutes/`
This folder contains tools to **transcribe meetings** (using Whisper-1) and **analyze content** (using LLaMA 3.2â€‘1B Instruct). It extracts key points, summaries, and action itemsâ€”ideal for automating meeting documentation.
